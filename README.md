This repository includes custom GitHub Copilot agents to enhance development workflows:

### Python Developer Agent

Located at `.github/agents/python-developer.md`, this expert agent provides:

- **Python Best Practices**: PEP 8, PEP 257, SOLID principles, and modern Python idioms (Python 3.11+)
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Always checks for and activates venv before running scripts or tests
- **Pytest Testing**: Comprehensive testing patterns including fixtures, parametrize, and mocking
- **MCP Server Integration**: Uses both Context7 and Microsoft-Docs tools to research package documentation and examples
- **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, error handling, and security considerations
- **Development Workflow**: From requirements analysis to code review

The Python Developer Agent helps maintain high-quality, well-tested Python code throughout the project, ensuring proper environment management and leveraging multiple documentation sources.
