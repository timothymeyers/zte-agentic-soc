# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] **AI-First Security Operations**: Does this feature use AI agents for security operations? Are the four core agent types (Alert Triage, Threat Hunting, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence) properly leveraged?
- [ ] **Agent Collaboration & Orchestration**: Does the design include proper orchestration of agent interactions? Is context sharing implemented?
- [ ] **Autonomous-but-Supervised Operations**: Are appropriate human approval gates defined for high-risk actions? Are audit logs in place?
- [ ] **Proactive Threat Detection**: Does the feature enable proactive hunting or predictive intelligence (if applicable)?
- [ ] **Continuous Context Sharing**: Is all security data properly integrated with Microsoft Sentinel? Are agents sharing context?
- [ ] **Explainability & Transparency**: Do agent actions include natural language explanations and rationale?
- [ ] **Continuous Learning & Adaptation**: Are feedback loops and learning mechanisms included (if applicable)?
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Are Azure AI Foundry, Security Copilot, Sentinel, and Defender XDR properly utilized?
- [ ] **Security & Compliance**: Are data protection, access control, and incident handling requirements met?

*Note: Not all principles apply to every feature. Document which principles are relevant and how they are satisfied.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
